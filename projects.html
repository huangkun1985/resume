        <li><strong>Pioneering a New Model for Actor Collaboration:</strong> I trained a high-fidelity <code>LoRA</code> model for a well-known Hong Kong actress, achieving exceptional character consistency. This was more than a technical breakthrough; it <strong>pioneered a new collaborative model for how actors can "star" in an AI film while retaining their unique essence</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Scene Consistency Workflow:</strong> I utilized <code>Flux Kontext</code> to generate highly coherent base scenes of the Arctic, combined with <code>Kling</code> for core dynamic shots, perfectly solving the scene stability challenge in long-form AI generation.</li>
