**Impact & Reception:**
*   The client highly acclaimed the "reborn" Naughty Bear, stating that the new image **successfully gave the character a new soul and vitality**, "as if it were truly alive among us."

Titled after his famous quote, "Don't Eat Bad Food," this short film uses AI to create an experience where audiences can **"hear his story, in his own voice."** The core technique involves morphing animations between his real-life photos, paired with an AI-cloned voice, to take viewers on an immersive journey through his remarkable life.

**Impact & Reception:**
*   The film received widespread praise on social media, standing out among numerous tributes to Mr. Chua and capturing significant public attention.
